# Python Script: Datadog - Telegram integration

>This code is a Python script that uses the Flask web framework to create a simple web application. The application listens for incoming HTTP POST requests at the /webhook endpoint, processes the received data, and sends a formatted message to a specified Telegram chat. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the code does:

## Import Libraries:

* Flask, request, and jsonify from the flask library to create the web application and handle HTTP requests and responses.
* requests to send HTTP requests to the Telegram API.
* json to handle JSON data.
  
## Initialize Flask Application:

`app = Flask(__name__)` initializes the Flask application.

## Define Constants:

`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are constants that store the Telegram bot token and chat ID, respectively. These are used to authenticate and specify the destination chat for the messages.

## Define Webhook Endpoint:

* The `/webhook` endpoint is defined to handle POST requests.
* When a POST request is received at this endpoint, the `webhook` function is executed.

## Custom API Key Requirement:

* The application expects a custom header `X-Custom-Header` in the incoming requests.
* This header should contain a JSON string with a secret key, for example: `{"secret": "YourSecretValue"}`.
* The application will validate this header to ensure that the request is authorized.

## Process Incoming Data:

* The incoming `JSON` data is extracted from the request and printed to the console for debugging.
* The `title` and `description` are extracted from the JSON data. The data structure assumes that these fields are nested within the event and embeds keys.


## Clean and Extract Description:

* Any occurrences of `%%%` in the description are removed.
* The code searches for specific keywords (`[ALERT], [WARN], [RECOVERED]`) in the description to find the start of the relevant message.
* If a keyword is found, the description is truncated to include only the message starting from the keyword up to the first newline character. If no keyword is found, a default message `"No alert message found."` is used.


## Format the Message:

* The `title` and cleaned `description` are formatted into a single message string.


## Send Message to Telegram:

* The `send_telegram_message` function is called with the formatted message.
* This function constructs a payload with the chat ID and message text, and sends it to the Telegram API using an HTTP POST request.
* If the message fails to send, an error message is printed to the console.


## Return Response:

The `webhook` function returns a JSON response indicating success.


## Run the Application:

The Flask application is configured to run on all available IP addresses (`0.0.0.0`) on port `5000`.

>In summary, this script sets up a Flask web server that listens for incoming webhook data, processes the data to extract and clean specific information, and sends a formatted alert message to a Telegram chat.

## Melange Configuration
The `melange.yaml` file is used to define the build process for the application as a package, defining:

* Removed User Creation and Switching: All lines related to creating a non-root user (adduser, chown, su-exec) have been removed.
* Environment Variables: The environment variables PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE and PYTHONUNBUFFERED are still set to improve performance and logging.
* Directory Setup: The directories for the executable and web application are still created and set up.
* Executable Script: The script to run the application is still created and made executable.
* Virtual Environment: The virtual environment is still set up and dependencies are installed.
* Working Directory: The working directory is still set and the application code is copied into it.
* Expose Port and Run Application: The port is exposed and the command to run the application is added to the Dockerfile.

## APKO Configuration

The `apko.yaml` file is used to define the environment and entrypoint for the application, using the app package created before and defining the executable as an entrypoint.
